Python + Flask Security Testing Project
üö® Disclaimer ‚Äì For Educational and Research Purposes Only
This project is developed strictly for educational purposes and aims to help understand security vulnerabilities, injections, and exploitation techniques in a controlled and ethical environment. The purpose is to learn about security flaws to strengthen applications and prevent attacks, not to exploit or misuse vulnerabilities.

üîç Purpose of This Project
This project explores how different injection techniques (such as SQL injection, command injection, and XSS) can be tested and mitigated in Python with Flask. By understanding these vulnerabilities, security researchers and developers can build more secure applications.

‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Guidelines

C# + .NET Security Testing Project
üö® Disclaimer ‚Äì Ethical and Legal Use Only
This project is an educational tool designed to help developers, students, and ethical hackers understand vulnerabilities and security risks in C# and .NET applications. It is meant for research purposes only and must not be used for illegal activities.

üìå Why This Project Exists
Security vulnerabilities exist in many applications, and developers must understand them to prevent exploits. This project helps users learn about:

Common web security flaws in .NET applications

Secure coding best practices to prevent security breaches

How attackers may exploit weaknesses (so developers can fix them)

‚ö†Ô∏è Rules and Ethical Use
Strictly for Educational Purposes: This project is a learning tool and must not be used for unauthorized access, hacking, or malicious activities.

Only Test on Authorized Systems: Running security tests on systems you do not own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical.

Follow All Cybersecurity Laws: You must ensure your actions comply with the law in your country. Violating laws such as the Computer Misuse Act, CFAA, or other cybersecurity regulations can have severe consequences.

No Liability: The author of this project takes no responsibility for how this code is used. If you choose to misuse this, you do so at your own risk.

üîß Technology Stack
Programming Language: C#

Framework: .NET

Security Concepts Covered: Authentication flaws, session hijacking, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities in .NET applications

‚ö†Ô∏è Final Reminder
By using or modifying this project, you agree to use it only for legal and ethical purposes. Misuse of this project for illegal activities is strictly prohibited, and I take no responsibility for any such actions.

C++ Security Testing Project
üö® Disclaimer ‚Äì For Research and Learning Purposes Only
This project is designed to help developers and security researchers understand low-level security vulnerabilities in C++ applications. It is a purely educational and research-based project, meant to demonstrate how exploits work and how they can be prevented.

üìå Objective of This Project
The goal of this project is to:

Teach developers about memory corruption vulnerabilities in C++ applications

Show how buffer overflows, pointer exploits, and stack-based attacks work

Help security professionals identify and mitigate security risks in C++ programs

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Ethical Guidelines
Using this project means you agree to the following ethical guidelines:

This Project is NOT for Malicious Purposes: It is intended only for security research and education.

No Unauthorized Use: Do not run or distribute this project in unauthorized or unethical ways.

Respect Cybersecurity Laws: You must comply with all applicable cybersecurity regulations in your country. Using this for unauthorized security testing is illegal.

Use in a Safe, Isolated Environment: When testing, always use a virtual machine or an isolated system to avoid unintended damage.

No Liability for Misuse: The creator of this project is not responsible for any consequences resulting from unethical or illegal use.

üîß Technology Stack
Programming Language: C++

Security Concepts Covered: Buffer overflows, memory corruption, pointer vulnerabilities, and other low-level security flaws

‚ö†Ô∏è Final Warning
This project is strictly for research and security education. If you misuse it in any way, you are solely responsible for the consequences. The author disclaims any liability for misuse or legal issues arising from unethical use.
